You are a senior front-end engineer working in a React + Tailwind + Framer Motion codebase.

TASK
Update the Section component divider animation so that:
1) The divider is a single consistent thickness across the full width (looks like one line).
2) The LEFT HALF of the divider is always visible in primary green.
3) The RIGHT HALF “draws” from the CENTER to the RIGHT edge when it comes into view.
4) The divider animation replays EVERY time I scroll past it (not just once).
5) Duration: 2s. Easing: decelerate toward the end (easeOut-like).
6) Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if reduced motion is enabled, show the full line instantly (no animation).
7) Avoid any “thicker right side” bugs (make sure we are not rendering 2 divider elements or stacking borders).

WHERE
Edit the Section component file imported as:
import { Section } from "@/components/sections/Section"
So the file is likely: src/components/sections/Section.tsx (or similar).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Replace the current {showDivider && (...)} divider code in Section with ONE divider block only.
- Use an absolutely positioned approach so layout doesn’t reserve empty space when scaleX=0:
  - container: relative h-px w-full
  - left half: absolute left-0 w-1/2 bg-primary (static)
  - right half: motion.div absolute left-1/2 w-1/2 bg-primary origin-left (animated scaleX)
- Use variants: hidden { scaleX: 0 }, visible { scaleX: 1 } with transition duration 2 and ease [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]
- Use whileInView + viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.9 }} so it replays on repeated scrolling.
- Ensure there is no seam at the center. Only add a -ml-px overlap if necessary; if it makes the center darker, remove it.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Scrolling down and back up past any section divider triggers the right-half draw animation again each time.
- Left half is always visible.
- Right half animates smoothly, slows near the end, and ends flush with the right edge.
- Line thickness is uniform across the entire divider.
- Works on desktop + mobile.
- Reduced motion setting disables the animation (line appears fully visible).

When done, list the exact files changed and show the final divider JSX you implemented.

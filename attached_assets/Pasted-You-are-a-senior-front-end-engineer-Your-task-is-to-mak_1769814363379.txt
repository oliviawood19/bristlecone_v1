You are a senior front-end engineer. Your task is to make my existing desktop-first web app fully mobile-responsive and touch-friendly, while preserving the current desktop UI and all text/content.

GOALS
1) Mobile-first responsive behavior (320px → 1440px).
2) No layout overflow on mobile (no horizontal scrolling).
3) Touch-friendly interactions (44px min tap targets, safe spacing).
4) Maintain the same brand fonts and color tokens already in the project.
5) Do NOT change the copy/text content; only restructure layout/styling.
6) Keep desktop experience the same or better.

SCOPE
- Update the layout of all major pages and shared components: header/nav, hero, cards/blocks, forms, modals, tables, and any grids.
- Add responsive breakpoints and utility classes / CSS, but avoid major refactors unless necessary.
- Prefer CSS Grid/Flex and responsive utilities over JS-driven layout.
- If using Tailwind: use responsive classes (sm/md/lg/xl) and container padding.
- If using CSS modules: create shared responsive helpers and apply consistently.

REQUIREMENTS (CHECKLIST)
A) GLOBAL
- Add a responsive meta tag if missing.
- Ensure the root layout uses max-width containers + responsive padding.
- Prevent overflow: audit widths, fixed positioning, and large images.
- Ensure typography scales: clamp() or responsive sizes for headings.
- Ensure consistent vertical rhythm on mobile (more spacing, fewer columns).

B) NAV / HEADER
- Desktop nav stays the same.
- On mobile: collapse nav into a hamburger menu or a simple stacked menu.
- Sticky header should not cover content; account for safe-area insets.

C) GRIDS / CARDS
- Convert multi-column grids to 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on small tablets where appropriate.
- Card padding and text sizes should adjust to avoid cramped layout.

D) FORMS
- Inputs full-width on mobile, labels readable, error states visible.
- Make buttons full-width where appropriate; 44px min height.

E) TABLES / DENSE DATA
- For tables: add horizontal scroll with a container OR transform into stacked rows/cards on mobile.

F) IMAGES / MEDIA
- Ensure images are responsive: max-width: 100%, height auto.
- Use object-fit and aspect ratios to avoid stretching.

G) PERFORMANCE / QUALITY
- Avoid layout shift.
- Keep animations subtle and performant on mobile.

DELIVERABLES
1) Implement changes and show me a concise summary of what you changed.
2) Provide before/after notes for the key components.
3) Create a small “Responsive QA checklist” and confirm each item is passing.

PROCESS
- First, scan the project and identify shared layout components and global styles.
- Second, implement responsive changes incrementally starting with the app shell (layout + nav), then each page section type (hero, grids, cards, forms, tables).
- Third, test at 320px, 375px, 390px, 414px, 768px.
- If any page still overflows horizontally, fix it before moving on.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do not change copy or information architecture.
- Do not introduce a new design system; use existing tokens.
- If you need to add a new utility (e.g., `container` class or `pagePadding`), do it once globally and reuse it.

When you’re done, list the files you changed and why.

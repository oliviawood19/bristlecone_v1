The Site does not require you to create an account or enter into any transaction with Bristlecone.

**1.2 Use on Behalf of an Organization.** If you access the Site on behalf of a business or organization, your use does not, by itself, create any agreement or relationship between Bristlecone and that organization. If you submit information on behalf of an organization, you represent you are authorized to do so.

**1.3 Geographic and Regulatory Restrictions.** The Site is controlled and operated from the United States. Nothing on the Site should be construed as an intention to market any securities, investment services, or investment opportunities in any jurisdiction where such offers are prohibited by applicable law. You are solely responsible for compliance with laws applicable in your jurisdiction.

**1.4 Binding Agreement.** These Terms form a binding agreement between you and Bristlecone. Each time you access or use the Site, you confirm your agreement to the then-current version of these Terms.

**2.2 No Offer or Solicitation.** Descriptions of Bristlecone’s business activities, including evaluation and acquisition of businesses, do not constitute offers or solicitations to sell or buy securities or investment advisory services in any jurisdiction.

**2.3 No Investment, Legal, Tax, or Other Advice.** The Site does not provide investment, legal, tax, accounting, or other professional advice, and you agree not to rely on the Site or its content for such purposes. Use of the Site does not create any advisory, fiduciary, or professional relationship between you and Bristlecone.
